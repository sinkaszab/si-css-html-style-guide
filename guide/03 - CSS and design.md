**SI*CSS + HTML**

## Inception Era
Imagine a long book. It has chapters, section and episode headings, body text, leads, dialogues, quotes, some illustrations, table of contents and maybe a bibliography. You really don’t have to worry too much about the layout. Easy job for CSS: lots of elements of the same type with practically zero diversity. 

**That’s precisely the kind of document CSS was originally designed for.**

## Publishing
The next idea was to get something done that resembles the classic newspaper format. Still low in diversity. A bit more concern and rules need to be added on the typography side and we need some new ones to cover the layout.

**Exactly why it is still manageable to design blogs with CSS.**

## Design Boom
Contemporary web design is all about providing high-quality visual experience. It resembles an expressive magazine layout. Complex layout and typography, levelling up brand to its print counterpart. Custom components; high diversity, fast-design ruling the scene and continuous usability improvements with A/B testing are in need. 

**As frontend developers we cannot rely anymore on old CSS principles, we have to continuously upgrade our methodologies to make a good match with the demands. Being able to change quickly with only the least side effects, deliver separate versions for testing, scale when needed and keep our codebase as maintainable as it can be.**
